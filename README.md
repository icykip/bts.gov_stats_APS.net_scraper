# bts.gov_stats_APS.net_scraper

Scraper for the Bureua of Transportation Statistics website which runs on a APS.net framework, likely applicable to other parts of the site 

This is my first attempt at scraping a website outside of class, first time using scrapy, and first time working with an APS.net framework, so it probably isn't to pretty, but learned a lot building it over the last couple of hours and thankful to have it for my DS4A project.
